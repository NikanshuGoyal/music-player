- This webapp uses Doubly Linked List for implementing music player
- Made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS3.
- Live Demo:ðŸ‘‡

## Project Overview:

The Music Player Using Doubly Linked List is a web-based application that allows users to manage and play their music playlists efficiently. 
The project combines the power of data structures with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive user interface and seamless playback experience.

* This website performs Lossless data compression and decompression of text(.txt) files using Huffman Algorithm.
* In this algorithm, a variable-length code is assigned to input different characters. The code length is related to how frequently characters are used. Most frequent characters have the smallest codes and longer codes for least frequent characters.
* A Huffman code is a tree, built bottom up, starting with the list of different characters appearing in a text and their frequency. 
* Compression ratio usually improves as the file size increases.
* The website is made responsive (with HTML and CSS ) and interactive (with JavaScript ).
